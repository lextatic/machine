# Lex's configurations

This repository contains my personal configurations for things like Windows, Linux, my terminals etc. I will therefore not accept any pull requests or changes to this repo.

Feel free to fork this repository or use it as an inspiration for your own configurations. In fact, this repo itself is inspired by [Patrik Svensson](https://github.com/patriksvensson)'s work in his [machine](https://github.com/patriksvensson/machine) repository.

## Disclaimer

Running the scripts here without knowing what they do will most likely make you sad and/or change your computer settings to something that you don't want.
