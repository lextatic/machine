# Windows configuration

It's recommended to run this in two steps.  
PowerShell must be launched as administrator.

# 1. Set execution policy

Launch PowerShell as administrator and run the following command.

```
> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

# 2. Install prereqs

There are some things that require a restart to work correctly,
so start by installing this.

```
> ./install.ps1 -Prereqs
```

After everything have been done, restart the computer.
If the script ask you if you want to restart the computer, 
do that, and run the script again after reboot.

# 3. Install applications and/or Ubuntu

```
> ./install.ps1 -Apps -VSExtensions -Ubuntu -Customization
```
